## Event Tracker Project
This is the week 11 weekend project for SD14.
#### Project Description
Event Tracker:
This project tracks how often my amazing beard gets stroked.  Seriously.

This project in its current state includes a single table database, a JPA
Project for entity mapping/controlling, and Spring Boot with REST to push/fetch
JSON from a front end.  Full CRUD is available on the single entity.

This project can be accessed by EC2 at 13.58.14.102:8080/<insert path>

Currently there is no UI/website for this project.  To access, modify, or delete
objects, utilize an API inspector such as Postman.

#### Using Event Tracker
The only current entity is Strokes, representing the amount of times my beard
has been stroked, by whom, and where.  The path to access the api is /api/.

*To access a list of all strokes available, the path /api/strokes with a GET request
will return all strokes.

*To access a single stroke via ID, the path /api/strokes/{id} where {id} = a valid
integer.


*To update a stroke, either by its entirety or by a single field, the path /api/strokes/{id}
with a PATCH request will allow header injection.

*To delete a stroke, the path/api/strokes/{id} with a DELETE requet will remove
the current entity from the list and database.
